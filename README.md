# Umineko no Naku Koro ni (Answer Arcs) - PS3 Voice and graphics patch

This patch aims to modify the newest release of Umineko by MangaGamer, changing its assets to replicate the PS3 version of the game.
It is compatible with the Steam version ***and*** the MangaGamer DRM-free download. See the roadmap below for current patch status.

# Warning - Steam Updates

Recent steam updates have been breaking patch installations. If you are an existing user or installing the game for the first time, please read the below.

It is **mandatory** that you move or rename your game directory so that steam is unable to perform automatic updates.
When steam updates Umineko, it overwrites the game script which can cause your save files to lose their position, **potentially skipping you forward in the game (causing spoilers)**.
Additionally, you may need to re-download the patch to fix any files overwritten by the steam update.
All steam features should still work when you run the game, as long as steam is already open.

The default location of the first game is roughly:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Umineko\
```

We suggest renaming the folder to:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Umineko Patched\
```

And likewise for the Answer Arcs, renaming `Umineko Chiru` to `Umineko Chiru Patched`

Or simply move the whole folder somewhere else, such as `C:\Games\Umineko`

In my experience, using steam's "don't update this game" feature doesn't always work, hence I recommend renaming the game folder.
