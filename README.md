# Umineko no Naku Koro ni (Answer Arcs) - PS3 Voice and graphics patch

> Calm down, this is pretty much a placeholder. The game will be released on November 17th and the patch will only reach a playable, stable release some time after that. **There are no public releases this moment**.

This patch aims to modify the newest release of Umineko by MangaGamer, changing its assets to replicate the PS3 version of the game.
It is compatible with the Steam version ***and*** the MangaGamer DRM-free download. See the roadmap below for current patch status.
