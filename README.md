### Steam Updates - Troubleshooting

**My saves are gone!**

 - you forgot to rename the `saves` directory to `mysav`
 - your game `.exe` was overwritten by steam - you need to replace it again

**'No game script found'** popup when launching the game
-  You forgot to rename the script file `0.utf` to `0.u` (located in the root game directory)

If you have any other problems, you can ask us on our discord server (see below).

The patch is still in progress, and all we want is to kill all the bugs. If you find anything, first check if the bug has already been reported.
