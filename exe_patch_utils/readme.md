## Important
The default resolution has been set to 1920 x 1080 (original game was 1280x960).

## Notes:
- When the python script patches the game .exe, it does not apply a diff, instead it searches for the instruction to set the width and height, then changes the value which is set. So in theory, even if the game is updated, it should still work.
